# Project Title
My Project is titled 'User Profile'.

## Description

A website that shows a user's profile displaying the name, email and interest's of the user which can be modified and updated by the user at any given time. The front end of the code was put together with the use of HTML, CSS, and Vue.JS. On the other hand, the backend was put together with the use of Node.JS while the database side of it made use of Mongodb. Automated Tests were done using Jest and supertest as dependencies.

## Getting Started
